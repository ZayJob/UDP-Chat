# UDP-Chat
UDP Chat in terminal
You need to make a chat (console or with the usual GUI - it doesnâ€™t matter).
It should be able to communicate with a person one on one and also create groups in which everyone will see messages from one person.
In the case of dialogue, after the message has reached the addressee, the client who sent it should show the status of "received".
Lab is based on UDP sockets.
